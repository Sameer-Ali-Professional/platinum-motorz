# Resend Email Setup Guide

## Step 1: Get Your Resend API Key

1. **Go to**: https://resend.com/signup
2. **Sign up** with your email (it's free - 3,000 emails/month)
3. **After signing up**, go to: https://resend.com/api-keys
4. **Click "Create API Key"**
5. **Name it**: "Platinum Motorz Production" (or any name you like)
6. **Copy the API key** - it starts with `re_` (you can only see it once!)

## Step 2: Add to Vercel (I'll help you with this)

Once you have the API key, I'll help you add it to Vercel using the command line.

## Quick Test

After setup, test by submitting a test drive request or enquiry form on your website. You should receive an email at `paviliomotorsofficial@gmail.com`.
